    <h2>What Makes a Good Dashboard</h2>
    <p>
      An effective dashboard is one that is clear, concise, and actionable. It should be easy for the audience to understand, process, and form their own decisions.
    </p>

    <h3>1. Define a Clear Purpose</h3>
    <p>
      To begin building an impactful dashboard, first define a clear purpose. What is the purpose of it? Will this dashboard be built to answer specific questions or help define a business goal?
    </p>
    <p>
      In terms of my customer churn project, my dashboard goal is simple: monitor churn rate while analyzing customer behavior.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Know Your Audience</h3>
    <p>
      After setting a goal, the audience needs to be determined. Tailor it based on the users. For example, if the audience is executives, they would be more familiar with high-level KPIs. As such, one would include these KPIs since this is what their audience is used to.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this project, the dashboard is presented to the public. Knowing this helps me focus on keeping the design, graphs, and charts easy to interpret and understand.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Tell a Story</h3>
    <p>
      A dashboard should tell a story. Begin with the most important metrics at the top, then work from left to right, up and down. This aligns with how users naturally scan a screen. Starting with key metrics allows users to connect supporting data below to those metrics, helping the dashboard "speak for itself."
    </p>

    <h3>4. Keep It Simple and Clean</h3>
    <p>
      Avoid clutter. Use white space strategically to allow charts and tables to stand out. Avoid unnecessary elements, and use simple, clear labels and headers.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Use Effective Visuals</h3>
    <p>
      Use the appropriate chart type for the message. Line charts are ideal for trends over time. Tables work well for detailed breakdowns.
    </p>

    <h3>6. Use Color Intentionally</h3>
    <p>
      Color should guide users, not overwhelm them. Use a consistent color palette. For example, use one color for "normal" and another for "alerts" or "warnings". Too many colors can distract from the dashboard’s message.
    </p>

    <h2>Dashboard Reflection</h2>

	<img src="/images/dashboard1.png" alt="First Dashboard Draft" />

    <p>
      Here is one of my earliest drafts. I applied the principle of storytelling by placing important metrics at the top and supporting charts below.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the user may feel overwhelmed with the number of graphs. Two different shades of blue are shown — do they mean different things? A gender graph uses color for differentiation, but other graphs use bright orange. Does the orange mean something?
    </p>
    <p>
      These unclear visuals make users ask more questions rather than gain insight. The dashboard feels cluttered and crowded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, the "Count of Churn Reasons" chart is cut off, making it ineffective. Chart titles are inconsistent and lack clarity — for example, not indicating that the metric is a percentage.
    </p>

    <h3>Improving the Dashboard</h3>
	
	<img src="/images/dashboard2.png" alt="Description of image" />

    <p>
      After identifying these weak points, I began to redraft. Sketching graphs helped. I highlighted the most important ones, organized the layout, adjusted colors, and refined titles.
    </p>

    <h3>Changes Made:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Inconsistent Color Scheme:</strong> I limited the palette to blue and orange. Blue represents ordinary data, while orange indicates warnings or churn risk. Gender graphs use muted gray and teal instead of stereotypical blue/pink.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Enlarged Visuals:</strong> The left graph is now larger and has dedicated space for better visibility.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Clearer Chart Titles:</strong> I made titles consistent and added “(%)” to signify percentage-based metrics.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      As a result, the final dashboard is cleaner and easier to understand. The layout now leads the user through the narrative, helping them connect metrics and take action.
    </p>

    <p>
      This ultimately helps businesses strategize better for customer retention based on clear, data-driven insights.
